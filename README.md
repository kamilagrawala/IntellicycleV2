IntellicycleV2
==============

Version 2 of Intellicycle senior design project. Oregon State. 
The intention of this project was to make an intelligent excercise bicycle.

There were many aspects to making this project happen.

1. The biycle had a Atmega microcontroller, which took information from the bicycle and transmitted via bluetooth to a android device.

2. The biycle had a power hub generator attached to the crank so energy could be harvested to power the phone and microcontroller.

3. The bicycle had 2 lithium ion batteries for backup power. ( <1.5lbs).

4. The Biycycle had a gps map utility embedded in the custom android app, to show current location and search directions.
